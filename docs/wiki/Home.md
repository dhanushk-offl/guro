## Project Vision

Guro is designed to provide high-fidelity system telemetry in a lightweight, terminal-based format. By prioritizing robust data acquisition and structured visualization, Guro serves as a reliable diagnostic bridge between low-level system sensors and the end-user.

## Technical Standards

Guro adheres to the following principles:
- **Accuracy**: Regex-free parsing of system outputs where feasible.
- **Efficiency**: Minimal resource overhead during monitoring.
- **Portability**: Cross-platform compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Clarity**: High-density information display using advanced TUI layouts.
